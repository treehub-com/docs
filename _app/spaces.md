# Spaces
Spaces are logical units or collections of family history resources. They consist of Trees (conclusions, sources, assertions), Discussions, Change Requests, Tasks, etc... They can be synchronized and shared. Each space has a unique identifier.

Within Treehub you always have a local space that is never synchronized, and 0 or more spaces that are synchronized from external sources (note that you do not create a local space and then sync. You create a remote space and then sync it down locally).
